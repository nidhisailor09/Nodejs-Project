# Nodejs-Project
Building a nodeJs application using mongodb cloud atlas and connecting it to nodeJs.
Also, I've used authentication for when user wants to access any routes and for that I've used bcrypt using JWT.
So, if you try to use any route before registering yourself it will throw error, therefore authenticating yourself will help you get access to routes.
Install all the dependencies before running any code.
